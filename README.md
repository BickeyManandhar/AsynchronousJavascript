# AsynchronousJavascript
Basic Asynchronou JS

project-1.html and project-1.js

 Here's a breakdown of what each button does:

1. "Show Images One at a time (Synchronously)": This button, when clicked, displays the images one at a time with delays using await. This makes it a synchronous operation, where each image is shown and hidden sequentially.

2. "Show Images all at once (Asynchronously)": This button, when clicked, displays all the images at once without delays. It showcases asynchronous behavior where all images are displayed simultaneously.
